# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains all my code and solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Solutions

Each day will have its own folder containing the problem statement and my solution in code.

- **Try it yourself first!**: I encourage you to attempt the challenges on your own before looking at my solutions.

- **Multiple Languages**: I use a variety of programming languages for these solutions, including **Java**, **C++**, and **C#**. makes the challenges more fun!

Happy coding! 🎅❄️
